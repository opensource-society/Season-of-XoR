## Summary of What I Built & How It Works ðŸš€

I built YourTutor, a responsive web platform that helps students find and book tutors online. It includes a Home, About, and Search section â€” all designed with smooth transitions and a consistent color theme.

The Home page introduces the platform and links to the search feature.

The About section explains what YourTutor offers and highlights key features.

The Search section lets users filter tutors by subject, rating, and experience, displaying matching results dynamically using JavaScript.

The project uses HTML for structure, CSS for modern styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript (ES6) for interactivity and filtering logic.
