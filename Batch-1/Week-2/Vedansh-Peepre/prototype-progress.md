## prototype progress
in this week,
* i've imported the 1.6 million tweets dataset as the source for my ML model of sentiment analysis.
* i've imported the dependencies required for this model, carried out the pre-processing & cleaning of data.
* defined the stemming function that is essential for the efficient data ingestion by the model

`TL;DR -laid the the groundwork of the project`
