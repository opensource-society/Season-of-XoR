## real world feasibility
while this project is not much of a problem solver in the real world, it still is a stepping stone and was a breakthrough at the time it was created / achieved.

the very idea of a programme to depict the sentiment behind a batch of words fascinates me.

and that is the real world feasibility of this project - it is a building block, a small piece of a large machine being formed, where a model can sense real human emotions deeply and accurately.
